A personal project made to improve my experience running and managing no-player character stats for my table-top gaming group.
It pulls mostly on fundamentals acquired earlier into the year and as such is a bit unrefined, but has helped me understanding
how important the planning process of a software project really is.

I can think of many a time that things had to be revisitted and revised due to oversights in early stages, which are lessons Ive
taken to heart in future projects. All in all this web application has served me well, and I am keen to maintain and improve upon
it further as my skills develop.
